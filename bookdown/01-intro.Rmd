## Background

1. tech cluster development

tech cluster & ttwa
In fact, between 2007 and 2014, the number of creative enterprises grew faster than the overall company population in more than nine out of ten of the UK's 228 Travel-to-Work-Area geographies (Mateos-Garcia，2016). 

There are high clustering effect among the England tech firms

By modeling the evolution of business growth and entry, this research contrasts the dynamics of the process by which regional clusters emerge in the US and UK computer industries. New enterprises are lured to both countries by industrial strength in specific sub-sectors in specific regions. Furthermore, incumbent firms in a cluster that is strong in their particular sub-sector of the industry expand at a quicker rate than the industry average. While there are significant second-order variations between the models estimated for the United States and the United Kingdom, the clustering dynamics appear to be comparable. There is no evidence that clustering effects are weaker in the United Kingdom than in the United States(Baptista and Swann, 1999).

2. dynamics cause better performance

dynamics and entry pattern
Many industrial dynamics patterns appear to be shaped by the process by which knowledge is created, gathered, and subsequently destroyed, because it favors the admission of new enterprises, the coexistence of incumbents and new entrants, and, eventually, their selective or combined exit over time (Krafft,2004).

3. industry clustering pattern and economics performances

## Research Question and Objectives

How does tech clusters' dynamics pattern change in UK from 1998 to 2018? / What factors can affect tech clusters' dynamics pattern change in UK?

To what extent will dynamic change affect tech clusters’performance？

Governments all across the world aim to grow their ICT sectors. As a result, researchers and policymakers want a comprehensive image of digital firms, but traditional datasets and typologies lag real-world change. We perform an alternative analysis for all active enterprises in the UK, focused on ICT-producing firms, using innovative "big data" resources.
(Nathan and Rosso, 2015)

The approach of spatial autocorrelation analysis is useful for revealing the structure and patterns of economic geographical variables. It can be used to identify not only the country's overall spatial patterns, but also specific micro-locations (Stankov & Dragićević, 2015).
