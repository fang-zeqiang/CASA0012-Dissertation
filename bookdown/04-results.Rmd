xxx illustrates the unconditional relation between exit hazard rate and age. Consistent with ..., the exit hazard rate decreases with age. This is the case because on average entrants are less productive than incumbents. As a cohort ages – see the right panel – the survivors’ productivity and value increase, leading to lower exit rates.
