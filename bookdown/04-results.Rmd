## Visualisation and Analysis of Tech Cluster

### Distribution

From 1998 to 2018, the entry rate of each Travel to work area (TTWA) in England will change drastically every ten years. For example, in 1998 the darker colored areas were mostly around the Greater London area and the entire southern part of England. The overall entry rate in 2008 was higher than that in 1998 and showed a trend of new companies entering the north of England. In this year, some ttwa areas on the edge of England have more prominent entry rates, such as Malton, Minehead and Bridport. However, the overall entry rate in 2018 was about twice as high as the average in 2008. Moreover, ttwa with high entry rate is mostly concentrated in the north and the surrounding areas of Greater London.

The figure below is the spatial distribution change in entry rate of tech clusters(ttwa) in England. The trend can be witnessed that there is an increasing trend in the overall level of entry rate from 1998 (average about 1.06% ) to 2018
(average about 14.33%)

xxx illustrates the unconditional relation between exit hazard rate and age. Consistent with ..., the exit hazard rate decreases with age. This is the case because on average entrants are less productive than incumbents. As a cohort ages – see the right panel – the survivors’ productivity and value increase, leading to lower exit rates.
