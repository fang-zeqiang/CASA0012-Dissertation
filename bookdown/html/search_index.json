Before the quantitative study, this study is based on time and The spatial dimension counts the number of technology companies, and calculates the dynamic indicators of enterprise clusters and industrial combination indicators in a specific year and a specific region. Then this study conducts multiple regressions, univariate and bivariate variables Moran index testing to conduct spatial quantitative research, and finally combines Qualitative spatial pattern trend research on the spatial changes of indicators in three different time periods 在本研究中，包含所有英国公司的数据集会被进行数据清洗和属性选择，并且根据英国政府官网对于科技企业的分类定义来进行科技公司的识别与筛选；在定量研究前，本研究基于时间与空间维度对科技公司数量进行统计，并且计算出特定年份特定地区的企业集群动态指标与产业组合指标；紧接着本研究进行多元回归，单双变量的莫兰指数检测来进行空间定量研究，最后结合三个不同时间段的指标空间变化进行定性的空间模式趋势研究 3.2 Data Source and Processing This raw dataset is collected from the core company data from Open Corporates master company database (Open Corporates, 2018). And the size of dataset accounts for 15 GB which is handled with read_stata and get_chunk function to read large data file in chunks, then increasing the reading speed. The “primary uk sic 2007” identification field is the basis of industry finding and the “birth year” is the key to measure dynamics variables . All rows whose these two values are empty are removed（17% incorperate date is missing and sic code is complete). 3.3 Identifying Tech Cluster For the identification of science and technology companies, this study introduces the main 2007 sic code table to judge the science and technology industry, referring to the classification method of the Science and Technology Classification data set on the ons.gov.uk website; in order to better identify science and technology companies for the UK The economic contribution is officially based on the 2007 British Standard Economic Activity Classification, combined with different data sources, to classify and label science and technology companies (Office for National Statistics, 2015). Table 1 2007 sic code for science and technology industry (part) SIC07 type …2 5-digit SIC07 code SIC07 heading …5 Science and Technology category Science and Technology topic Class … 26110 Manufacture of electronic components … Digital Technologies Computer &amp; Electronic manufacturing Class … 58210 Publishing of computer games … Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services Class … 62090 Other information technology and computed service activities … Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services Class … 63110 Data processing, hosting and related activities … Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services Class … 27510 Manufacture of electric domestic appliances … Other scientific/technological manufacture Electrical Machinery manufacturing Class … 86230 Dental practice activities … Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare Healthcare services This research refers to the science and technology classification table provided by the government. The technology indicator is used to position the technology industry of all industries, and a total of 168 sic codes for the technology industry in 2007 were obtained, accounting for about 16% of all industry categories in the UK, including 5 industry categories such as Digital Technologies, Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare, Publishing &amp; Broadcasting , Other scientific/technological manufacture and Other scientific/technological services, details of the classification form will be attached in the attachment. There are almost 20% firms in the raw data belonging to tech firms according to the method of category as mentioned above. 3.4 Quatitative Analysis and Methods 3.4.1 Time Range Selection The reason why this research choose tech firms which incorporate from 1998 to 2018 is because 这20年来科技公司在英国的成立数量相比1998年以前明显走高正如图1所示 Figure 1 Incorporating technology &amp; science companies in UK 3.4.2 Tech Cluster Identifying Why I choose ttwa Why ttwa can work as a firms’ cluster 3.4.3 Dynamics Measuring Index \\[ Entry\\ Rate_{i,t} = \\frac{Incorporating\\ Firms_{i,t}}{Total\\ Firms_{i}} \\] Where \\(i\\) means location(travel to work area), \\(t\\) means year 3.4.4 Dynamics Analysis 3.4.5 Herfindahl Index \\[ Herfindahl\\ Index_{i,t,k} = \\frac{Tech\\ Firms_{i,t}}{Total\\ Firms_{i}} \\] Where k represents industry 赫芬达尔—赫希曼指数 [1] (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index，简称HHI），简称赫芬达尔指数，是一种测量产业集中度的综合指数。它是指一个行业中各市场竞争主体所占行业总收入或总资产百分比的平方和，用来计量市场份额的变化，即市场中厂商规模的离散度。 赫芬达尔一赫希曼指数是计算某一市场上50家最大企业(如果少于50家企业就是所有企业)每家企业市场占有份额(取百分之的分子)的平方之和。显然， HHI越大，表示市场集中程度越高，垄断程度越高。该指数不仅能反映市场内大企业的市场份额，而且能反映大企业之外的市场结构，因此，能更准确地反映大企业对市场的影响程度。 3.5 Limitations missing data diss_year have 99% missing value ttwa ttwa might not be a data-driven method ttwa的时间局限性，因为是2015年统计的 ttwa的变化(Ozkul,2014) Ozkul, B., 2014. Changing home-to-work travel in England and Wales. Regional Studies, Regional Science, 1(1), pp.32-39. 3.6 1. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index 3.7 Ethical Statement The data for this project comes from OpenCorporates, a firm which aggregates company-level data from around the world [link to their website]. In this case, OpenCorporates have taken data from the UK Companies House register [link to Companies House]. As detailed by Nathan and Rosso (2015), all limited companies in the UK need to registers with Companies House when they are set up, and provide annual returns and financial statements. These include details of directors and company secretary, registered office address, shares and shareholders, as well as company type and principal business activity. Thus, all the data used here is already in the public domain. The research objectives are tech firms in the UK for this project and the individual data will not be collected and measured in this project. For issues of deanonymisation or privacy, traceable information such as the real companies name and ID will not be utilised in the research. The raw data will be cleaned and filtered by several key variables include industries instead of the company’s name or other sensitive information before doing the research. Through data cleaning, pre-processing, desensitisation or other processing methods, the risks of damage to company interests (such as social reputation, economic benefits and etc.) will be mitigated to an as low as possible level in the research process. Besides, this project will not cause discrimination of industries or job categories. The final analysis results, such as the different industry concentration in each region, will not deepen some people’s stereotypes and prejudices about the region (This content will be fully discussed in the project discussion section). It is necessary to point out and declare the objectivity of the analysis and the non-absoluteness of the results in the disclaimer. Consider the feelings of people and governments in different parts of the UK, this research will prevent the influence of personal preferences and subjective emotions. The leakage of companies’ name and information will be protected. For example, in the reflection of the results section of academic research, the name and related information of the companies that moved may be revealed. Although this information may be open to the public you need to know that this information may be used by people with other ulterior motives. This project will desensitise the company name and information at the stage of chart presentation, such as using A, B, and C to replace them to achieve this purpose.
