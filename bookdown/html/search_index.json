This paper reviews what constitutes a tech cluster, how they function internally, and the degree to which policy makers can purposefully foster them. We describe the growing influence of advanced technologies for businesses outside of traditional tech fields, the strains and backlash that tech clusters are experiencing, and emerging research questions for theory and empirical work. 2.2 Cluster Dynamics Industrial dynamics and clusters: a survey, regional research. This article reviews clusters and their impact on the entry, exit, and growth of firms, as well as the literature supporting the evolutionary dynamics of cluster formation. This extensive review shows strong evidence that clusters promote the entry of manufacturers, but the evidence that clusters can promote the growth and survival of firms is rather weak. From a number of open-ended questions, this research extracts various future research paths that emphasize the importance of manufacturer heterogeneity and the exact mechanism that supports the localized economy. 2.3 Location Quotient On average, companies in large cities are more productive. There are two main explanations: corporate choice (big cities strengthen competition and only allow the most productive people to survive) and agglomeration economies (big cities promote interaction and increase productivity), which may be strengthened by the natural advantages of localization. In order to distinguish them, we nested a general version of the easy-to-handle company selection model and a standard agglomeration model. Stronger choices in large cities cut the distribution of productivity to the left, while stronger gatherings move to the right and expand the distribution. Using this forecast, French firm-level data, and new quantile methods, we show that firm choices cannot explain differences in spatial productivity. The results are applicable to various departments, city size thresholds, institutional samples and regional definitions. 2.4 How location affect entry pattern in UK/Global 2.5 How time affect entry pattern in UK/Global 2.6 Other factor can affect dynamics pattern in UK "],["methodology.html", "Chapter 3 Methodology 3.1 Research Framework 3.2 Data Source and Processing 3.3 Quatitative Analysis and Methods 3.4 Limitations 3.5 Ethical Statement", " Chapter 3 Methodology 3.1 Research Framework Data Clean &amp; Select Tech Cluster Filter Measuring the Dynamics 3.2 Data Source and Processing Data Source Data Clean The large dta file is handled with read_stata and get_chunk 去进行大数据的分块读取，提高15GB数据的读取速度 对于primary_uk_sic_2007标识字段进行去空，即该列下为空的行都去除，并且把数据类型转成int32 引入2007 sic code表来进行科技产业的判断，参照了ons.gov.uk网站的Science and Technology Classification数据集划分方式，如下表 为了更好识别科学与技术企业对于英国经济的贡献，官方基于2007年英国标准经济活动分类，结合不同数据源头，对科学与技术企业进行分类标签(Office for National Statistics, 2015) 这里参照官方提供的Science and Technology Classification表中Science and Technology indicator来进行所有产业的科技产业定位，得到科技产业的2007 sic code共计168个，约占英国所有产业分类的16%，包括5个产业大类如Digital Technologies, Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare, Publishing &amp; Broadcasting, Other scientific/technological manufacture and Other scientific/technological services，该分类表格详情会附在附件里 Office for National Statistics, 2015.
