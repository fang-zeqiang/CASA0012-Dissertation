In terms of the development of high-tech industries, UK is becoming increasingly attractive to international investors. And the scale of VC investment in the UK had reached the third level in the world in 2020, even if it is severely affected by the covid-19 epidemic (Tech Nation, 2021). The UK tech startup and scaleup ecosystem are also valued well. Investment and relative infrastructures are friendly for tech companies (ibid). In fact, high technology companies are often investigated from the dimension of travel to work areas in many fields of research. For example, some reports found that, between 2007 and 2014, the number of creative tech enterprises grew faster than the overall company population in more than nine out of ten of the UK’s 228 travel to work area geographies (Mateos-Garcia，2016). There are clustering effects existing among the England tech firms. Some research teams such as Baptista (1999) conducted growth model research and dynamic model mining on regional clusters of technology industries and found that the growth rate of the sub-category business of a specific industry in the cluster may be higher than the industry average and a certain agglomeration phenomenon. Some teams also had done research on employment changes in the corresponding technology research and development industry. Also, the employment growth of high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seems to depend on the initial level of clusters, and the impact of this clustering effect on employment growth varies greatly in geographic scope (Fingleton et al., 2004). Although there are obvious differences in clustering characteristics between the technology industries in the UK and other areas, the cluster effect of the technology industry in the UK did not seem to be weaker than that in the United States (Baptista and Swann, 1999). The dynamics characters of clusters can be measured by their entry pattern. Many patterns of industrial dynamics appear to be affected by the process of knowledge creation, gathering, and destruction. This promotes the admission of new businesses, the long-term coexistence of incumbents and newcomers, and their selected or combined withdrawal (Krafft, 2004). In terms of industry clustering pattern and policy formulation, Nathan and Rosso (2015), in response to the development needs of governments for ICT sectors, utilise big data resources to conduct an innovative alternative analysis for all active ICT manufacturers in the UK. This can help researchers to better understand the current condition of the UK’s ICT industry. Meanwhile, the approach of spatial autocorrelation analysis is useful for revealing the structure and patterns of economic geographical variables. It can be used to identify not only the country’s overall spatial patterns but also specific micro-locations(Stankov and Dragićević, 2015). Our research can employ these methods and background information to explore the technology industry dynamics and obtain sufficient argument evidence. 1.2 Research Question and Objectives In order to contribute to this field research, the main purpose of this research is to explore the spatial pattern of tech clusters characteristics, introduce quantitative methods to explore the relationship between cluster dynamics, industrial concentration and density. The research will focus on the following main questions: To what extent will industry mix and firms density affect tech clusters’ dynamics in England area？ How does tech clusters’ dynamics spatio-temporal pattern change in England area from 1998 to 2018? The overall experiment will be carried out around the above-mentioned central question. Breaking down the above central issues, the objectives to be achieved at each stage of this research are divided into 5 points as follows Review the relevant literature on the use of regression models to identify the relationship between company clusters and find the empirical research which employs Moran’s index(Moran’s I), local indicators of spatial association(LISA) and hot-spot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* method Processing and filtering data which can represent the dynamics and related characters of each tech cluster area in England from 1998 to 2018 Exploring the relationship between tech cluster dynamics, industry concentration and company density through trend analysis and regression models Based on the mining and visualisation of related spatial indicators, understand the spatial autocorrelation of relevant indicators and the trend in the temporal dimension among various travel to work areas (TTWAs) within the England area. Combine with actual policies to provide guidance and recommendations at the company level and the government level based on regression results and spatial model mining results 1.3 Report Structure This research paper contains 6 chapters. Chapter 2 will first compare and summarise the current research status of tech cluster dynamics in the UK and other parts of the world. In Chapter 3 methodology, the research scale and object will be explained. Data processing process and index data summarised in different dimensions will be presented. Research design combining multiple quantitative methods will also be included in this chapter. Chapter 4 will analyse the changes in distribution and explore the influence relationship among variables from the overall to the partial. In addition, this chapter will compare the global and local indices for spatio-temporal analysis. Chapter 5 will discuss the experimental results based on the actual relevant policies of the England authority, and give investment suggestions at the government and enterprise levels for the development of the tech industry and discuss the limitations of the research framework. Finally, Chapter 6 will summarise key findings to respond to the research questions and make recommendations for future study and planning strategies. "],["lit-review.html", "Chapter 2 Literature Review 2.1 Industrial Cluster and Tech Cluster 2.2 Industrial Dynamics 2.3 Industry Concentration 2.4 Other Factors and Dynamics Pattern 2.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 2 Literature Review 2.1 Industrial Cluster and Tech Cluster A cluster is described as a geographic concentration of businesses that operate in the same industry. High rates of entry and exit are often correlated with growth in employment and productivity, so these questions are of interest not only to academics but also to policymakers (Fritsch, 2011). Industry clusters form as a result of the production benefits of local specialization mixed with cross-regional trade. Three forces of what is now known as agglomeration economies were discussed previously: knowledge spillovers, labour market pooling, and customer-supplier interactions. While most Marshallian force studies have focused on industrial contexts, they also apply to tech clusters, albeit in slightly different ways (Ellison et al. 2010). The definition of tech clusters is mentioned in Kerr’s research(2020) as given below we define “tech” clusters to be locations where new products (be they goods or services) and production processes are created that impact multiple parts of the economy. In identifying Information and communications technology (ICT) relative economic activities, They find ICT employment shares nearly double the usual estimates using their unique approach even if this conclusion is more speculative(Nathan and Rosso, 2015). The definition and tech relative industry information can give a brief understanding of our research objects. 2.2 Industrial Dynamics Industrial dynamics is still a relatively new subject of research. Its main focus is on the evolution of industries, with an emphasis on company entry, growth, and exit(Malerba, 2006). Industrial dynamics, in contrast to the neoclassical approach to industries (also known as industrial organization), focuses primarily on phenomena that are intrinsically dynamic and deals with them in an interdisciplinary manner such as economic geography(Carlsson 1987;Fritsch, 2011). In industrial clutser analysis, concepts of anchor firms for clusters are developed by some researchers. This thesis indicates that big corporate headquarters can help a specific area attract many other firms to form a new cluster and this anchor firm is usually recognised as the basis of the cluster (Feldman, 2003; Porter, 1998). For the cluster dynamics, the cluster has a strong influence on the company’s entry behaviour. The relevant research team found that the entry rate increases as the cluster size increases (Frenken et al., 2014). Most of the research focuses on the correlation between industry dynamics and localisation but there is little extensive quantitative research on the relationship between industry concentration and entry pattern(Furman et al., 2002; Shaver and Flyer, 2000). Relative researchers found that industry clustering not only can increase firm entry but also firm exit rates. This implied that clusters could emerge and exist because they provide entry opportunities but they do not necessarily generate Marshallian economies that increase firm survival (Boschma, 2015;Alcacer and Chung, 2007). Some teams investigate cluster emergence and evolution over the long term by looking at how clusters influence entry, exit, and growth via localisation economics(Kogut,1991). Besides, Clementi and Palazzo(2016)found there is a cluster effect on the whole of England area. The arrival of new businesses has a significant impact on the overall dynamics. The cluster’s new entrants will grow in size over time, resulting in broader expansion and overall influence. This research framework can be referred to our quantitative measurement of cluster dynamics. 2.3 Industry Concentration In competition law, antitrust, and technology management, the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) is a widely used economic concept. It’s a metric for a company’s size in proportion to its industry, as well as a barometer for how competitive it is (Liston-Heyes and Pilkington, 2004). On average, businesses in big cities are more productive. The natural advantages of localisation may enhance corporate choice and agglomeration economies. Large cities encourage competition by enabling only the most productive individuals to stay, fostering contact and increasing productivity(Porter and Stern, 1999). Tremblay et al.(2005) have studied the relationship between the brewing industry and the entry of enterprises from a macro and micro perspective. They found that regional technological changes will lead to an increase in industry concentration and macro-fields. Excessive industrial prosperity and high concentration will lead to a decline in business entry and a decline in survival rates(ibid). The Herfindahl–Hirschman index is also used to highlight the dynamic patterns of the sustainability sector, which is crucial for understanding how startups have applied the concept of sustainability(Kwon, 2020). 2.4 Other Factors and Dynamics Pattern The density of regional firms may have a two-sided impact on the entry pattern. Because each firm has the ability to bring in new entrants, firm density has a positive effect on entry rates in the early stages of an industry. Due to severe market rivalry, higher firm density levels, on the other hand, become a barrier to entry as the industry expands and flourishes (Boschma, 2015). Meanwhile, empirical research shows that the relationship between business size and the likelihood of survival is influenced by technology and the stage of the industry life cycle (Agarwal and Audretsch, 2001). Studies have also shown that entry may be less about radical innovation and more about filling strategic niches in established businesses that are nonetheless technologically intensive, neutralizing the impact of entry size on the likelihood of survival(ibid). There is also evidence that a negative relationship between firms’ age and growth over time is because more and smaller firms such as factories create more jobs than some large companies(Liu et al., 1999). For firms’ growth and failure, Moreno’s research(2000) found that the failure rate and growth rate of companies decline with the growth of scale and age. Regression-to-the-mean is not an important factor in the negative correlation between the size and growth of surviving companies. And he also offers empirical evidence of firm failure rates as well as the mean of the distribution of realized growth rates. 2.5 Conclusion Overall, by reviewing the past literature on industrial clusters and enterprise dynamic models, it can be found that industrial dynamics is still a relatively novel research topic in the UK. Usually, the characteristics of research clusters can be conducted in an interdisciplinary way such as economic geography. As a region with obvious cluster effects, the UK’s industrial clusters can increase the entry of enterprises. And there is also a reference for the relevant literature on the quantitative measurement method of the entry index. In terms of industry concentration, a certain degree of industrial concentration in the short term may attract companies to enter, that is, industry prosperity within a certain period of time. But excessive entry will also cause industry shocks. Through the research review of the dynamic pattern of enterprises, it is also found that the regional density level, the age of enterprises or clusters and etc. have an influence on the entry pattern of enterprises.

The areas in blue colour is the main research area (Figure 3.1). In this study, a data set containing all companies in UK will be cleaned and attribute selected, and technology companies will be identified and screened according to the classification and definition of technology companies on the official website of the British government. Before the quantitative study, this study is based on time and The spatial dimension counts the number of technology companies, and calculates the dynamic indicators of enterprise clusters and industrial combination indicators in a specific year and a specific region. Then this study conducts multiple regressions, univariate variables Moran index testing to conduct spatial quantitative research, and finally combines Qualitative spatial pattern trend research on the spatial changes of indicators in three different time periods(1998, 2008 and 2018). Figure 3.1: The Map of Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) within UK 3.2 Data Source and Processing This raw dataset is collected from the core company data from Open Corporates master company database (Open Corporates, 2018). And the size of dataset accounts for 15 GB which is handled with read_stata and get_chunk function to read large data file in chunks, then increasing the reading speed. The “primary uk sic 2007” identification field is the basis of industry finding and the “birth year” is the key to measure dynamics variables . All rows whose these two values are empty are removed（17% incorperate date is missing and sic code is complete). 3.3 Identifying Tech Clusters For the identification of science and technology companies, this study introduces the main 2007 sic code table to judge the science and technology industry, referring to the classification method of the Science and Technology Classification data set on the ons.gov.uk website. In order to better identify science and technology companies for the UK. The economic contribution is officially based on the 2007 British Standard Economic Activity Classification, different data sources were combined to classify and label science and technology companies (Office for National Statistics, 2015).The 5-digital sic code can identify the economic activity classification of the technology industry in the finest granularity. The statistics bureau provided a comparison table of sic codes for the classification of science and technology industries, which can help this research to better identify technology companies from the big data of UK companies (3.1). Table 3.1: Science and Technology Classification Sample (Part) 5-digit SIC07 code Science and Technology category Science and Technology topic 26110 Digital Technologies Computer &amp; Electronic manufacturing 58210 Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services 62090 Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services 63110 Digital Technologies Digital &amp; Computer Services 27510 Other scientific/technological manufacture Electrical Machinery manufacturing … … … 86230 Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare Healthcare services This research refers to the science and technology classification table provided by the government. The technology indicator is used to position the technology industry of all industries, and a total of 168 sic codes for the technology industry in 2007 were obtained, accounting for about 16% of all industry categories in the UK, including 5 industry categories such as Digital Technologies, Life Sciences and Healthcare, Publishing and Broadcasting , Other scientific/technological manufacture and Other scientific/technological services, details of the classification form will be attached in the attachment. There are almost 20% firms in the raw data belonging to tech firms according to the method of category as mentioned above. 3.4 Data Scale 3.4.1 Time Range Selection The reason why this research choose tech firms which incorporate from 1998 to 2018 is because the number of technology companies established in the UK in the past 20 years is significantly higher than before 1998, as shown in below figure. Figure 3.2: Incorporating technology and science companies in UK 3.4.2 Tech Cluster Identifying Travel to Work Locations is official statistics that capture local labour markets, i.e., areas where the majority (approximately 70%) of the people who live there work. These measures are based on responses to the 2011 and are used to define the TTWAs algorithmically. There are currently 228 TTWAs in the UK. When it is recognised that the activity of interest may be scattered across administrative boundaries such as local authority districts or NUTS areas, TTWAs are widely utilised in industrial clustering investigations (Prothero, 2021). Relevant studies have shown that commuting across towns has become more common in England and Wales. People are not limited to living and working in the same administrative area. In addition, studies have found that low-skilled workers tend to rely on the public to work locally. Strong skill-oriented jobs are more dependent on cars, and they are also the main force for cross-city commuting. The technology industry has a greater demand for those strong skill-oriented workers which suggest that travel to work area(TTWA) is used as a cluster of technology companies compared to traditional administrative Region would be a good choice (Titheridge and Hall,2006) The University of Cambridge had funded some researchers to undertake the Wisbech 2020 Vision project to analyse the current problem, mining the potential future space for employment growth with alternative macro-economic scenario to help drive a high value-added growth plan in the local area (Burgess et al., 2014) This geographical division can better reflect the relationship between population, company and work. In terms of geographic research, related researchers have combined the Business Structure Database (BSD) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and industry classification methods to use the ONS geographic area of TTWA to survey the commuting patterns and labour market of the population in 2011. Most scholars state that this might be an effective measure for the research of industrial clusters at the sub-regional level (Mateos-Garcia，2016). 3.5 Quatitative Analysis and Methods 3.5.1 Dynamics Measuring Index Firm entry is the result of the interaction between the characteristics of an actor, on the one hand, and the surrounding environment, on the other hand (Frenken, Cefis and Stam, 2014). To measure the degree of dynamic change of a cluster, it is necessary to calculate the entry rate of the technology cluster. Brandt used the enterprise’s entry rate and exit rate to measure the dynamics attributes of a company (2005). This research refers to the researcher’s calculation method. The number of enterprises entering and quitting a sector as a percentage of the total number of firms in the same sector in a given year is used to compute entry rate in this tech cluster dynamics research(ibid). The calculation method is as follows. \\[ Entry\\ Rate_{i,t} = \\frac{Incorporating\\ Firms_{i,t}}{Total\\ Firms_{i}} \\] Where \\(i\\) means location(travel to work area), \\(t\\) means year 3.5.2 Industry Mix Measuring Index It is necessary to calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index or location quotient of the technology cluster to measure the degree of industrial concentration in a cluster area. However, only the former method is used because the employment data corresponding to the corresponding region year is missing; Here is a reference to the quantitative method of industrial concentration of Chao Lu’s research team (2017). HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing company and then adding the results, where the market share is given in the form of scores or points (ibid). Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite (Hall et al., 2009), as the calculation method shown below. \\[ HHI_{\\ i,t} = \\sum_{j=1}^N (\\frac{Tech\\ Firms_{j,i,t}}{Total\\ Tech\\ Firms_{i,t}})^2 \\] Where: \\(HHI_{i,t}\\) means Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in location \\(i\\) and year \\(t\\) \\(N\\) is the overall number of individual tech firm contained. \\(k\\) represents the \\(k\\)th industry in location \\(i\\) and year \\(t\\). \\(Tech Firms_j\\) is the number of j-th individual tech firm \\(Total Tech Firms\\) represents the number of total tech firms in a specific location and year. 3.5.3 Regression In order to quantify the impact of industry concentration and company density in the cluster on the cluster dynamic variable (entry rate), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and company density corresponding to the year and location(i.e. ttwa) in the data are used as independent variables (Table 3.2). And the variable of the numeric data type of entry rate is regarded as the dependent variable Table 3.2: Independent Variables Selection for Regression Independent Variables Type Description Density numeric The density of tech firms Herfindahl-Hirschman Index numeric The index measuring the industry mix Year category Years from 1998 to 2018 Location category Top ten clusters of companies in England Dynamics variable(entry rate) is measured empirically by the ratio of the number of new firms at the end of a period to the total number of firms at the beginning of the period(Hause and Du Rietz, 1984), unless otherwise stated. The equation regression model is given: \\[ \\ y\\ =\\ b_0 + b_1 \\ x_1 + b_2 \\ x_2 + \\sum_{i=3}^{4} \\ b_i \\ x_i + \\epsilon_{i,j} \\] Where \\(y\\) means entry rate in the year and location \\(x_1\\) means the year, a dummy variable \\(x_2\\) means location, i.e. travel to work area(TTWA) \\(x_3\\) means the density of tech firms in a specific year and location \\(x_4\\) means Herfindahl-Hirschman Index in in a specific year and location \\(\\epsilon_{i,j}\\) is a random error. 3.5.4 Global Autocorrelation (Moran’s I) One of the most popular and often used measures of spatial autocorrelation is Moran’s Index. Based on the locations and values of the feature, the Global Moran’s I tool analyzes the pattern of a data set spatially and decides if it is scattered, clustered, or random. The program calculates the Moran’s I Index value, as well as the z-score and p-value, to statistically validate the Index. It is computed using the formula below (Kumari and et al., 2019). \\[ Moran&#39;s \\ I = \\frac{n}{S_0} \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^n \\sum_{y=1}^n w_{x,y} z_x z_y}{\\sum_{x=1}^n z_x^2} \\] \\[ S_0 = \\sum_{x=1}^n \\sum_{y=1}^n w_{x,y} \\] Where \\(z_x\\) stands for deviation of an attribute from its mean \\((x_i – X̅)\\) for feature \\(X\\), \\(w_{x,y}\\) is the spatial weight among feature \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), \\(n\\) is the total number of features and So is the summation of all spatial weights The statistic’s \\(z_j\\) score is given below \\[ z_x = \\frac{I - E[I]}{\\sqrt{V[I]}} \\] where \\[ E[I] = \\frac{-1}{(n-1)} \\] \\[ V[I] = E[I^2]-E[I]^2 \\] The Moran’s Index(I) has a range of values from -1 to 1. Index value 1 indicates that the observed pattern is spatially clustered. On the other hand value -1 indicates scattering or dispersion. Moran’s I assign a value of near or equal to zero to the lack of auto correlation. The z-score and p-value of the Index are only used to form final judgments regarding the observed pattern. Besides, local indicators of spatial association will be applied to measure the high-high and low-low clusters(Anselin, 2010). According to research method of Kumari’s team(2019), the Moran’s I of three time period will be calculated to analysis the dynamics change in spatial and temporal aspects. 3.5.5 Hot-Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) Only positive spatial autocorrelation is taken into account by the local Getis statistics, which allows for discrimination between clusters of similar values that are high or low relative to the mean. The Getis–Ord local statistics are calculated as follows by Getis and Ord (2010): \\[ G^*_j = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^nw_{i,j}x_j - \\bar{X}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{i,j}}{S\\sqrt{\\frac{[n\\sum_{j=1}^{n}w^2_{i,j} - (\\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{i,j})^2)]}{n-1}}} \\] where \\(x_j\\) is the attribute value for feature \\(j, w_{i,j}\\) is the spatial weight between feature \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), \\(n\\) is equal to the total number of features and: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j}{n} \\] \\[ S = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x^2_j}{n} -(\\bar{x})^2} \\] The Gi* statistic returned for each feature in the dataset is a z-score (Getis and Ord, 2010). For statistically significant positive z-scores, the larger the z-score is, the more intense the clustering of high values (hot spot). For statistically significant negative z-scores, the smaller the z-score is, the more intense the clustering of low values (cold spot). 3.6 Limitations In term of missing value in the original dataset, there are almost 99.8% missing value in dissolution date. This means that most companies do not have a dissolution date, which might not mean that some companies survive, nor can it accurately reflect the company’s exit numbers in a specific year and region. Moreover, the company’s incorporation date data (including firms birth year) is also missing about 17.26%. These two difficulties make the data after cleaning process may have the risk of insufficient accuracy in representing the dynamics of the industry. The model prediction after fitted to this dataset might not reach the same situation as the real world level. England travel to work areas might not be a data-driven method to identify the clusters. This spatial boundary data is not an up-to-date dataset because it is lastly updated in 2015. Changes in commuting have pushed TTWA boundaries further since their inception in the 1980s. With the passage of time, the boundaries of TTWA will be further changed in the future due to changes in commuting methods(Ozkul,2014) which might make this research slightly inappropriate in the future application. The value of this statistical data(Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) for identifying monopoly development, on the other hand, is directly dependent on the precise definition of a market (Kwoka, 1977). For instances, geographical considerations might influence market share. This dilemma can arise when there are nearly equal market share of tech businesses in a given sector, but they each operate exclusively in distinct regions of the travel to work area, resulting in each firm having a monopoly inside the specific marketplace in which it conducts business, which might make it more difficult to measure the industry mix in a specific location and year. Furthermore, one IT firm may control as much as 70% of the market for a certain area of the digital industry (i.e. the sale of one specific equipment). As a result, that company would have a near-total monopoly on the manufacturing and sale of that commodity. 3.7 Ethical Statement The data for this project comes from OpenCorporates, a firm which aggregates company-level data from around the world(https://opencorporates.com/). In this case, OpenCorporates have taken data from the UK Companies House register (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house). As detailed by Nathan and Rosso (2015), all limited companies in the UK need to registers with Companies House when they are set up, and provide annual returns and financial statements. These include details of directors and company secretary, registered office address, shares and shareholders, as well as company type and principal business activity. Thus, all the data used here is already in the public domain. The research objectives are tech firms in the UK for this project and the individual data will not be collected and measured in this project. For issues of deanonymisation or privacy, traceable information such as the real companies name and ID will not be utilised in the research. The raw data will be cleaned and filtered by several key variables include industries instead of the company’s name or other sensitive information before doing the research. Through data cleaning, pre-processing, desensitisation or other processing methods, the risks of damage to company interests (such as social reputation, economic benefits and etc.) will be mitigated to an as low as possible level in the research process. Besides, this project will not cause discrimination of industries or job categories. The final analysis results, such as the different industry concentration in each region, will not deepen some people’s stereotypes and prejudices about the region (This content will be fully discussed in the project discussion section). It is necessary to point out and declare the objectivity of the analysis and the non-absoluteness of the results in the disclaimer. Consider the feelings of people and governments in different parts of the UK, this research will prevent the influence of personal preferences and subjective emotions. The leakage of companies’ name and information will be protected. For example, in the reflection of the results section of academic research, the name and related information of the companies that moved may be revealed. Although this information may be open to the public you need to know that this information may be used by people with other ulterior motives. This project will desensitise the company name and information at the stage of chart presentation, such as using A, B, and C to replace them to achieve this purpose. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Spatial and Temporal Distribution 4.2 Regression Analysis 4.3 Spatial Autocorrelation", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Spatial and Temporal Distribution In terms of three variables’ change of overall England level,it can be found that the average firms’ entry rate and density in England increase significantly(Figure 4.1). There was a growth in firms entry rate from 0.01(1998) to 0.14(2018) and the statistics of density climb from 0.02 to 0.43 during these decades (Table 4.1). However, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index decreased by less than 0.1 in 2018 which is 1/3 times than that in 1998. Overall, it can be seen that the dynamics increased but the industry concentration reduced.

For example, in 1998 the darker colored areas were mostly around the Greater London area and the entire southern part of England(Figure 4.2). The overall entry rate in 2008 was higher than that in 1998 and showed a trend of new companies entering the north of England. In this year, some travel to work areas on the edge of England have more prominent entry rates, such as Malton, Minehead and Bridport. However, the overall entry rate in 2018 was about twice as high as the average in 2008. Moreover, ttwa with high entry rate is mostly concentrated in the north and the surrounding areas of Greater London. The overall trend can be witnessed as given by Table 4.1 that there is an increasing trend in the overall level of entry rate from 1998 (average about 1.06% ) to 2018 (average about 14.33%) Finally, from the perspective of changes in temporal and spatial distribution, the increase in the entry rate of the travel to work area in the northern part of England is much larger than that in the southern part. The areas with high entry rates before 2008 were mostly scattered in other areas except for the Greater London area. However, close to after 2018, London and its surrounding areas, the central Manchester-Birmingham area and the southwest, such as Exeter, have a rising entry rate. In contrast, in 2008, the urban agglomerations north of Leeds had higher firm entry rates in tech industry(Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: The Distribution of the Firms Entry Rate of the England Travel to Work Areas(TTWAs) from 1998 to 2018 4.1.2 Tech Industry Mix In terms of herfindahl-Hirschman index of tech industry in travel to work area of England. As given figure below, it can be seen that the Herfindahl-Hirschman index has a downward trend year by year (Figure 4.3). In the methodology module, this index is mentioned as a measure of industrial concentration. A decrease in the value represents an increase in industrial competition and a decrease in market power. The decline of the index means that the types of SIC codes corresponding to companies in a particular region have increased in a year or the number of companies corresponding to a large share of SIC codes has decreased. In other words, the types of technology industries corresponding to the unit area have increased, or the number of advantageous industries has decreased; you can see The concentration of technology industries out of England declined year by year from 1998 to 2018 (Table 4.1). In the same way, the diversity of the technology industry is also increasing, and the richness of the industry may also be related to the increase in the entry rate of enterprises. From the perspective of temporal and spatial distribution, the technology industry was concentrated in northern England, northern and southwestern England before 2008. With the passage of time, even if the concentration of industries in some small areas scattered on the border of England is still high, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index in these places has gradually decreased to a level comparable to that of the Greater London area(Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: The Distribution of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the England Travel to Work Areas(TTWAs) from 1998 to 2018 4.2 Regression Analysis For 149 tech clusters(travel to work areas), the regression results can indicate the relationship among cluster dynamics, industry mix and firms density in different years(1998-2018) and locations (149 tech clusters). Among these three models, the model with outliers excluded and logarithmic processing of the dependent variable performed better. It can be seen that the Herfindahl-Hirschman index has a negative correlation with the tech cluster dynamic variable (entry rate) but the density has a positive effect. Taking Model [3] as an example, every time this indicator decreases by one unit, the entry rate might increase by about \\(e^{1.37}\\) unit times higher than the original one. The high confidence of this coefficient can explain 99% of all observation data. On the contrary, for the density of these tech clusters in Model [3], every time the density increases by one unit, the corresponding dependent variable entry rate will be about \\(e^{0.5}\\) unit times more than the original one (Table 4.2). Although the HHI and Density values of the three models are not the same, the positive and negative effect of the relationship are similar. For example, for the industrial concentration variable HHI, all three models show a negative correlation (Table 4.2). And when HHI and Density change the same unit, the former seems to have a greater impact on the entry rate (it may increase the dependent variable entry rate by more than \\(e\\) times in both model 1 and model 2) Table 4.2: Regression Results of Firms Entry Rate and Tech Clusters’ Characters Model [1] [2] [3] Method OLS OLS OLS Sample all areas all areas exclude 2018 London Dep.

These two independent variables are controlled to be added in the regression model which can help to observe to what extent they can have an influence on the dynamics element(entry rate). When the year and regional conditions in the model remain unchanged, the model [1] only adds Herfindahl-Hirschman index to consider the regression analysis, and it can be found that the coefficient is about -1.2 and the confidence level is greater than 95%. Similarly, the model [2] only considers adding firm density into the fitting, the coefficient of this independent variable is about 0.38 and the statistical significance is also less than 5%. However, when other conditions are the same, adding two variables into the model at the same time [3], the absolute value of each coefficient increases, and the confidence level increases, and the overall goodness of fit is also improved (Table @ref(tab :tab-regression-control-var)). In terms of Herfindahl-Hirschman index, the entry rate might decrease when this indicator increase(Table 4.3). Consistent with model[2], the entry rate increase with density (Table 4.3). The HHI decrease and density increase, leading to lower entry rates.

The confidence of global Moran’s I in 1998 is as high as 95%. But the statistical significance of 2008 is lower than 10%, which indicates weak interpretability of these two years(Table 4.4). Table 4.4: Global Moran’s Index of Firms Entry Rate in Three Time Periods Year Moran’s Index p value z-score 1998 0.118 0.00 2.438 2008 0.062 0.08 1.348 2018 0.056 0.10 1.238 Contrary to the entry rate variable, the density attribute value of England has always maintained a relatively obvious spatial aggregation phenomenon, although the global Moran’s Index of the density variable has been decreasing year by year. This variable has higher confidence in global Moran’s I statistics in the three-year statistics, thus its interpretability is higher than that for mentioned entry rate (Table 4.5). Table 4.5: Global Moran’s Index of Firms Density in Three Time Periods Year Moran’s Index p value z-score 1998 0.436 0.00 10.078 2008 0.325 0.00 7.545 2018 0.189 0.00 4.982 4.3.1 LISA Analysis of Firms Dynamics Local Indicators of Spatial Association(LISA) According to the Table 4.6, the z-score with its significance can be found. Table 4.6: Correspondence of Z-score and P-value Z-score p-value confidence less than -1.65 or more than 1.65 less than 0.10 0.90 less than -1.96 or more than 1.96 less than 0.05 0.95 less than -2.58 or more than 2.58 less than 0.01 0.99 The visualisation result of the local Moran’s index’s Z-score of Entry rate is as similarly indicated by the global Moran coefficient (Figure 4.2). With the growth of the year, the overall agglomeration effect of England has decreased. But, in this process, the agglomeration effect in the northern region was higher than that in other regions. However, the travel to work areas in the southwest corner changed significantly from the early cluster effect in 1998 to the corresponding outliers such as Low-High, High-Low areas in 2018 (Figure 4.4 ). In addition, from Figure 4.3, the higher industrial concentration in the north also makes the phenomenon of dynamics agglomeration more obvious than that in other places in England area To be more specific, High-High clusters in 1998 are mainly concentrated in travel to work areas in northern areas such as Newcastle, southern areas such as Andover-Newbury, and the southwest of Exeter. The entry rate values around these places may be higher than the British average. The Low-Low clusters of entry rates are clustered in the northern North Yorkshire area. The surrounding areas of these places usually have relatively close entry rates and low entry rate values; With the passage of time, the High-High cluster has shifted (the north like Whitehaven and the southwest corner like Launceston areas with higher entry rates gradually formed). By 2018, High-High cluster only appeared in travel to work areas around Liverpool, and new low tech firms entry rate areas were formed in Workington and Penrith&amp;Appleby (Figure 4.4) Central regions of England such as London, Birmingham and other regions have not had obvious spatial clustering effects in the visualisation results. This may be due to the low statistical confidence of the local Moran’s index among regions. Or it might be because the data in this study is aggregated before calculated. The related data may be missing after the HHI and entry rate are utilised, which might not perfectly represent the company information in some parts of England. Figure 4.4: Local Moran’s I Spatial Analysis for Entry Rate in England for Three Time Periods 4.3.2 Hot-Spot Analysis of Firms Dynamics This research identified and mapped local clusters (hot and cold spots) by the level of entry rate for these three period. On the whole, there is a distinct north-south difference in the distribution of cold and hot spots in the early stage(1998). With the development of England tech clusters, this difference is slowly dissipating and a reversal is formed eventually(Figure 4.5). More specifically, in 1998, there were some hot spots concentrated in the Swindon-Bristol-Reading urban belt in the south-central area and the southwest urban agglomeration of Exeter. Whilst, in the north, there were scattered cold spots represented by the Whitehaven area. By 2008, most of the hot spots disappeared, and the places that were hot spots gradually became cold spots, such as the southwestern region. In 2018, some hot spots appeared in the northwestern region along with England. The original two hot spots in the southwest have experienced two-time nodes in 2008 and 2018, and they finally turned into cold spot clusters(Figure 4.5).

In addition, the relationship between the entry rate of tech companies in England and the different indicators of the clusters (including firms density and the concentration of tech industries) is also quantitatively explained based on the results of the regression model and the spatial autocorrelation test. In a nutshell, under the current research framework, whether it is the entire area of England or the local tech clusters, the experimental results in the past 20 years (1998-2018) have shown that industrial concentration and company density have a strong relationship with the entry rate of cluster technology companies. For example, the higher the industrial diversity and the greater the density of local technology companies, the higher the entry rate of technology companies in the region. In addition, the visualisation of spatio-temporal patterns also found the shift of cold and hot spots. For instance, compared with England as a whole, the cluster effect of the entry rate in some areas in the north has declined more slowly, while the southwest has changed from a cluster with a high entry rate to a cluster with a low entry rate. These findings can help government planning decision-makers to optimise the investment distribution of science and technology industries in England, thus realising the fair development of resource allocation among the England science and technology industries in the future. Although the research framework has some limitations, the regression model and spatial autocorrelation analysis methods have good reproducibility in explaining the areas whose administrative divisions are similar to the UK. For the expansion of research directions, this research can refer to Clementi’s (2016) analysis framework to investigate the dynamics of a cross-section of enterprises and their implications for aggregate dynamics. In addition, with the development of the technology industry and the trend of globalisation, the government’s collection and archiving of more dimensional data of these companies would help to employ quantitative methods to explore the survival mode of tech companies. In addition to a more multi-dimensional quantitative analysis, this research can also focus on studying the impact of corporates’ movement in the future, especially the change of the same company address and other corporate indicators such as the size of employees and assets before and after the relocation.
