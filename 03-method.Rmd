# Equations and direct quotes

This section will focus on equations and direct quotes

## Equations {#equations}

You need to include equations with some LaTeX. The easiest way to do this is to use an online tool such as: https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php. It can be a real pain to get these right, but once you've worked it out it will be much easier than dealing with word equation editor. 

\begin{equation} 
  p= h\frac{c}{\varrho}
  (\#eq:test)
\end{equation} 

To reference this in the text we use: \@ref(eq:test)

You can also test your code in your RMarkdown document using `$` e.g. $$p= h\frac{c}{\varrho}$$

However, this won't generate an equation number and you can't cross reference it. But we can use this logic to define the parameters within the equation e.g. where $h$ is Plank's constant, $6.626 Ã— 10^-34 Js$

`$$` puts it on a new line, single `$` keeps it on the same line (in the text)

## Block quotes (or direct quotes) {#quotes}

You may wish to quote a large section from a source, to do this use a block quote. 

Simply input a `>` before the text. For example ` > This is a quote`. 

> "This is a direct quote" 

You can also provide an attribution at the footer of the quote using `tufte::quote_footer()`, either a name or a reference. You'll need to install the `tufte` package to use this. For example, `> [include only r here] tufte::quote_footer('--- Joe Martin')` or ` > [include only r here] tufte::quote_footer('--- @xie2015')` 

Giving...

> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Joe Martin')`

> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- @xie2015')`

Instead you could just include the reference at the end of the quote, using the same method to reference as we've seen before..e.g. `> "This is a direct quote" @xie2015, Equation \@ref(eq:test)`...giving 

> "This is a direct quote" @xie2015 \@ref(eq:test)
