You could look at literature on TTWAs to argue that they are a good representation of local economies; you could also argue that limitations in OC address data mean it’s sensible to aggregate firms to TTWA level (again, you will need references to back that up). 3.2.2 Dynamics Measuring Index I need to refer to lit review 3.3 Quatitative Analysis and Methods 3.3.1 Tech Cluster Identifying sic4 code tech cluster 3.3.2 Dynamics Analysis entry / exit / churn pattern incorporation / dissolution date 3.3.3 Location Quotients 3.4 Limitations 3.5 Ethical Statement "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Visualisation and Analysis of Tech Cluster 4.2 Visualisation and Analysis of Dynamics 4.3 Figure &amp; Table", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Visualisation and Analysis of Tech Cluster 4.1.1 Distribution 4.1.2 Descriptive Analysis 4.2 Visualisation and Analysis of Dynamics 4.3 Figure &amp; Table This section is going to focus including figures and creating tables Figure 4.1: Summary of methdological procedure for (a)…. and (b)…. knitr::include_graphics(here::here('general_images','example_flow.png')) out.width=\"100pt\", fig.cap=\"Summary of methdological procedure for (a).... and (b)....\".
